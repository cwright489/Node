<h2>Readme Generator</h2>

<h3>Snapshot</h3>
I wanted to make this application so that I could easily print Readmes. Every developer dislikes making readmes! I wanted to make sure that I had an easy way to use Node.js to be type inputs in and have it write straight to a Readme file. Next I want to learn how to get images posted in there dynamically.

<h3>How to Install</h3>
Use NPM Install from inside the terminal and you can run it by using node index.js
